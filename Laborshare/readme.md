# Overview of Required Datasets
##### Public access is permitted with appropriate citation.:
  * Datasets such as US-Census, OECD STAN, KLEMS, ONET, UN-Comtrade, and others are open to the public. 
  * We recommend utilizing the KLEMS data and codes provided by us.
    * Although direct download from the website listed below is possible, we advise against this approach.
      * To access the 2023 vintage release of KLEMS, please visit https://euklems-intanprod-llee.luiss.it/.
      * For downloading all available vintages, please refer to the replication code and data provided by Gutiérrez, G., and Piton, S. (2020).
      * Please note that downloading all vintages directly from the official KLEMS webpage may not be efficient, or it could require a considerable amount of time.
##### The dataset listed below is not available for public access.
```diff
- It is impossible to fully replicate the study from scratch without the datasets listed below.
```
  * EU-LFS:
    * Although this dataset is free, accessing it requires an application for data permission, which is typically processed within approximately two months.
    * We are utilizing the 2023 release of this dataset.
    * After downloading, please save the file in the /Secured/EULFS folder located in the current directory.
    * The file format should appear as follows:
